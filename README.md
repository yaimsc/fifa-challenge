# Adidas Fifa Challenge

This is a Frontend ReactJS Web Application project by Yaiza MuÃ±oz.

Thank you for giving me this opportunity!

## Technologies & Libraries used

For the project I have used:
- React with Hooks & Functional Components
- React Router for navigation to show final selection
- LocalStorage for browser data persistency
- For styling & Components: SASS & Material UI
- For cleaning code & code formatting: ESlint & Prettier
- React Testing Library for tests (basic tests as I try learning a bit with the challenge)
- Github Actions for automated deployment into Github Pages

## Start the Project
### Open Project on localhost

Clone the project into you local to run the app in the development server.

First of all, you'll need to install all the required dependencies to be able to open the project correctly. Run the following command:

`npm install`

There is a **.env.example** file in the project. Copy this one the make it a **.env** file to put your API_KEY_SECRET

The API used to collect all the data is: [football-data.org API](football-data.org)

You can start the server into your localhost with the following command:

`npm start`

This will open localhost:3000

### Web App Page

On `.github/Workflows/deploy.yml`there is the Github Action to automate the deploy process of the React Web App into Github Pages.

The link to the site is the following one:

If you have any trouble with the link and something is not correclty or the page is blank, don't hesitate on contacting me.

Aswell you can deploy the content with:

`npm run deploy`

### Launch the test runner

For launching the test and watch that everything is okay, run the following command:

`npm test`

#### Known Bugs

When you are selecting players:
 - Mexico Players not showing due to API (the rest of country - players works fine, this issue comes from the API itself.
 - ~~You need to add one more player than usual, as the setter of the array append goes with 1 select delay.~~
  On `src > components > SelectTeamPlayers.js > addPlayer()` is the code to see how I am doing the process.
  `v1.0`
  **Bug fixed.** Set localstorage on showSelectedPlayer().
Tests:
- `Finalteam.test.js` is not the correct test as it involves localStorage process and was more complex. I just strated today with tests & try the basic ones.
